# This command-line tool is written in Rust, not Python, but it is distributed
# on PyPI (so it can be installed using pip, even though it does not provide an
# importable Python module), and it uses Python for testing. Since we judge
# that cramjam-cli is distributed on PyPI only for convenience of installation
# for pip users (similar to the cmake and ninja projects on PyPI), we choose to
# use %%cargo_build/%%cargo_install directly. This diverges slightly from
# upstream’s practice but is more straightforward.
#
# If we used %%pyproject_wheel/%%pyproject_install, we would get Python
# metadata in %%{python3_sitearch}/cramjam_cli-%%{version}.dist-info/ that
# would allow us to provide python3dist(cramjam-cli), but this would also
# create an otherwise-unnecessary dependency on the Python interpreter. If we
# needed to package this metadata, we would probably want to do it via a
# python3-cramjam-cli subpackage that contained only the metadata (and had a
# fully-versioned dependency on the base package) in order to keep the base
# package from depending on Python.

# Note that the tests compare compressor output against python-cramjam, so
# tests are only guaranteed to pass when python-cramjam and cramjam-cli are
# built with the same Rust crate dependencies. For example, updating rust-lz4
# without rebuilding python-cramjam could cause this package to FTBFS in
# Koschei because the test-rebuild would use a newer rust-lz4 than the
# python-cramjam build in the repositories used.
