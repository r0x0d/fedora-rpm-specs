%description
Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate 
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance(); 
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There 
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when 
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions 
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor. 
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor 
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling 
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases 
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated 
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without 
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in 
  non-standard ways.
