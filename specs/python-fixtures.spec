%global _description %{expand:
Fixtures defines a Python contract for reusable state / support logic,
primarily for unit testing.  Helper and adaption logic is included to make it
easy to write your own fixtures using the fixtures contract.  Glue code is
provided that makes using fixtures that meet the Fixtures contract in unittest
compatible test cases easy and straight forward.}
