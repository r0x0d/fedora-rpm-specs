Summary:        %{summary}

# The bundled version is quite close to upstream. It has some “ignore” type
# annotations added, some if statements were reordered (apparently to put this
# library’s common case first for performance), and an LRU cache layer was
# added.
#
# When the type annotations were the only difference, we unbundled this as a
# downstream patch. Now we bundle again, but we have asked upstream about a
# path to unbundling—a request which was mandated by
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#bundling:
#
#   Path to using upstream py27hash as a dependency?
#   https://github.com/aws/serverless-application-model/issues/2815
#
# Upstream refused: “Unfortunately due to how the SAM transform is consumed
# this would be a little tricky, so unless there's customer impact, it's not
# something we're looking to change at this time.”
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(py27hash)) = 1.0.2
