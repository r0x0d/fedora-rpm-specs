%global _description %{expand:
Boltons is a set of over 230 BSD-licensed, pure-Python utilities in the same
spirit as — and yet conspicuously missing from — the standard library,
including:

 * Atomic file saving, bolted on with fileutils
 * A highly-optimized OrderedMultiDict, in dictutils
 * Two types of PriorityQueue, in queueutils
 * Chunked and windowed iteration, in iterutils
 * Recursive data structure iteration and merging, with iterutils.remap
 * Exponential backoff functionality, including jitter, through
   iterutils.backoff
 * A full-featured TracebackInfo type, for representing stack traces, in
   tbutils}
