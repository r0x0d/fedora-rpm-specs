%global _description %{expand:
Graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical
analysis of graphs (a.k.a. networks). Contrary to most other python modules
with similar functionality, the core data structures and algorithms are
implemented in C++, making extensive use of template metaprogramming, based
heavily on the Boost Graph Library. This confers it a level of performance that
is comparable (both in memory usage and computation time) to that of a pure
C/C++ library.

Please refer to https://graph-tool.skewed.de/static/doc/index.html for
documentation.}
