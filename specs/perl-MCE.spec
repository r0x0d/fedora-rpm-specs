%description
Many-core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance by
maximizing all available cores. MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore
does not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead, MCE follows
a bank queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and bank-tellers the
parallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the ability to chunk
the next n elements from the input stream to the next available worker.

    during global destruction (GH#22)

* Fri Jul 19 2024 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 1.897-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_41_Mass_Rebuild

* Thu Jun 20 2024 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.897-1
- Update to 1.897
  - In scalar context, the init function in MCE Child and models Flow, Grep,
    Loop, Map, Step, and Stream returns a guard to call finish automatically
    upon leaving the { scope } (i.e. omitting finish)
  - Add out_iter_callback to MCE::Candy

* Wed Jun 12 2024 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.896-1
- Update to 1.896 (rhbz#2291411)
  - Weaken internal core MCE reference to reap workers automatically upon
    leaving the scope i.e. omitting shutdown
    - Note: No change to MCE models Flow, Grep, Loop, Map, Step, and Stream
    - Call finish explicitly to reap workers
    - This resolves the case when omitting calling $mce->run(), $mce->run(1) or
      $mce->shutdown() inside a scope, causing workers to linger around until
      completion of the script

    MCE::Child cannot assume the srand or setter function used by the
    application for predictability
    - https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11159834
    - https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11159827

    matches non-threads for CORE, Math::Prime::Util and
    Math::Random::MT::Auto (see https://perlmonks.org/?node_id=11159834)
  - Preserve functionality for older Perl, non-threads

- Update to 1.891 (rhbz#2290695)

    user_tasks (i.e. task_id ≥ 0); previously, only task_id == 0
  - Improved IPC on the Windows platform for edge case when a worker is
    awaiting input while the manager process is restarting a worker
  - MCE, MCE::Child workers exit immediately upon receiving a SIGSEGV signal;
    this safeguards IPC from stalling inside the manager process
  - Enhanced the _wait_one private function in MCE::Child
  - Removed Prima from the list for auto-enabling the posix_exit option; Prima
    (since 1.52) is parallel safe during global cleanup

  New Features
  - Added MCE::Mutex::Channel2 providing two locks using a single channel; the
    secondary lock is accessible by calling methods with the '2' suffix, e.g.
    primary mutex ->lock, ->unlock; secondary mutex ->lock2, ->unlock2
  - Added MCE::Channel providing queue-like and two-way communication
    supporting threads and processes
  - Added MCE::Child and compatibility with Perl 5.8; MCE::Child is based on
    MCE::Hobo, but using MCE::Channel for data retrieval without involving a
    shared-manager process
  - Added MCE::Channel examples { channel1.pl and channel2.pl } using threads
    and MCE::Child respectively
  Enhancements
  - IPC update; removed unnecessary overhead including private methods _sysseek
    and _syswrite from MCE::Util (no longer needed)
  - Improved MCE->do, now callable by workers and the manager process
  - Updated MCE::{ Flow, Grep, Loop, Map, Step, and Stream } documentation on
    passing an array reference versus a list for deeply input data
  - Updated and re-organized the top-level MCE documentation, particularly
    improved clarity for the 'MCE Models' section
  - Removed MANIFEST.SKIP
  - Update MCE::Channel POD documentation
