# Upstream defaults to C++11, but recommends building c4core and rapidyaml with
# the same standard; and rapidyaml is built as C++14 because gtest 1.13.0 or
# later requires C++14 or later. Since c4fs supports the tests for c4core, it
# makes sense to apply the same advice here as well. See:
# https://github.com/biojppm/rapidyaml/issues/465#issuecomment-2307668270
