%description
ATD stands for Adaptable Type Definitions. It is a syntax for defining
cross-language data types. It is used as input to generate efficient and
type-safe serializers, deserializers and validators. The current target
languages are OCaml and Java.

The following opam packages are provided by the atd project:

* atdgen: executable that generates OCaml code dealing with json and
  biniou data formats
* atdj: executable that generates Java code dealing with json
* atd: library for parsing atd files used by code generators


%package        devel
Summary:        Development files for %{name}
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires:       ocaml-easy-format-devel%{?_isa}
Requires:       ocaml-re-devel%{?_isa}
Requires:       ocaml-yojson-devel%{?_isa}

%description    devel
The %{name}-devel package contains libraries and signature files for
developing applications that use %{name}.


%package -n     ocaml-atdgen
Summary:        Generates efficient JSON serializers, deserializers and validators
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}
Requires:       ocaml-atdgen-runtime%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n ocaml-atdgen
Atdgen is a command-line program that takes as input type definitions in the ATD
syntax and produces OCaml code suitable for data serialization and
deserialization. Two data formats are currently supported, these are biniou and
JSON. Atdgen-biniou and Atdgen-json will refer to Atdgen used in one context or
the other. Atdgen was designed with efficiency and durability in mind. Software
authors are encouraged to use Atdgen directly and to write tools that may reuse
part of Atdgenâ€™s source code.


%package -n     ocaml-atdcpp
Summary:        C++ code generation for ATD
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n ocaml-atdcpp
Atdcpp takes type definitions in the ATD format and derives C++ classes
that can read and write JSON data.  This saves the developer the labor
writing boilerplate that converts between dicts and classes.

This allows safe interoperability with other languages supported by ATD
such as D, OCaml, Java, Python or Scala.


%package -n     ocaml-atdd
Summary:        DLang code generation for ATD
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n ocaml-atdd
Atdd takes type definitions in the ATD format and derives `dlang`
classes that can read and write JSON data.  This saves the developer the
labor writing boilerplate that converts between dicts and classes.

This allows safe interoperability with other languages supported by ATD
such as C++, OCaml, Java, Python or Scala.


%package -n     ocaml-atdj
Summary:        Java code generation for ATD
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n ocaml-atdj
Atdj is a program that generates a Java interface from type definitions. In
particular, given a set of ATD type definitions, this tool generates a set of
Java classes representing those types with built-in JSON serializers and
deserializers.

The primary benefits of using the generated interface, over manually
manipulating JSON strings from within Java, are safety and ease of use.
Specifically, the generated interface offers the following features:

- JSON strings are automatically checked for correctness with respect to the ATD
  specification.

- Details such as optional fields and their associated default values are
  automatically handled.


%package -n     ocaml-atdpy
Summary:        Python/mypy code generation for ATD
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n ocaml-atdpy
Atdpy is a program that generates a Python interface from type definitions. In
particular, given a set of ATD type definitions, this tool generates a set of
Python classes representing those types with built-in JSON serializers and
deserializers.

The primary benefits of using the generated interface, over manually
manipulating JSON strings from within Python, are safety and ease of use.
Specifically, the generated interface offers the following features:

- JSON strings are automatically checked for correctness with respect to the ATD
  specification.

- Details such as optional fields and their associated default values are
  automatically handled.


%package -n     ocaml-atds
Summary:        ATD Code generator for Scala
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n ocaml-atds
Atds is a program that generates a Scala interface from type definitions. In
particular, given a set of ATD type definitions, this tool generates a set of
Scala classes representing those types with built-in JSON serializers and
deserializers.

The primary benefits of using the generated interface, over manually
manipulating JSON strings from within Scala, are safety and ease of use.
Specifically, the generated interface offers the following features:

- JSON strings are automatically checked for correctness with respect to the ATD
  specification.

- Details such as optional fields and their associated default values are
  automatically handled.


%package -n     ocaml-atdts
Summary:        TypeScript code generation for ATD
Requires:       %{name}%{?_isa} = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n ocaml-atdts
Atdts takes type definitions in the ATD format and derives TypeScript
classes that can read and write JSON data.  This saves the developer the
labor writing boilerplate that converts between dicts and classes.

This allows safe interoperability with other languages supported by
ATD such as C++, OCaml, Java, Scala, or Python.
