%description
The ScaLAPACK (or Scalable LAPACK) library includes a subset 
of LAPACK routines redesigned for distributed memory MIMD 
parallel computers. It is currently written in a 
Single-Program-Multiple-Data style using explicit message 
passing for inter-processor communication. It assumes 
matrices are laid out in a two-dimensional block cyclic 
decomposition.

ScaLAPACK is designed for heterogeneous computing and is 
portable on any computer that supports MPI or PVM.

Like LAPACK, the ScaLAPACK routines are based on 
block-partitioned algorithms in order to minimize the frequency 
of data movement between different levels of the memory hierarchy. 
(For such machines, the memory hierarchy includes the off-processor 
memory of other processors, in addition to the hierarchy of registers, 
cache, and local memory on each processor.) The fundamental building 
blocks of the ScaLAPACK library are distributed memory versions (PBLAS) 
of the Level 1, 2 and 3 BLAS, and a set of Basic Linear Algebra 
Communication Subprograms (BLACS) for communication tasks that arise 
frequently in parallel linear algebra computations. In the ScaLAPACK 
routines, all inter-processor communication occurs within the PBLAS and the 
BLACS. One of the design goals of ScaLAPACK was to have the ScaLAPACK 
routines resemble their LAPACK equivalents as much as possible.
