%global _description %{expand:
Elephant (Electrophysiology Analysis Toolkit) is an open-source,
community centered library for the analysis of electrophysiological
data in the Python programming language. The focus of Elephant is on
generic analysis functions for spike train data and time series
recordings from electrodes, such as the local field potentials (LFP) or
intracellular voltages. In addition to providing a common platform for
analysis code from different laboratories, the Elephant project aims to
provide a consistent and homogeneous analysis framework that is built
on a modular foundation. Elephant is the direct successor to Neurotools
and maintains ties to complementary projects such as OpenElectrophy and
spykeviewer.

Elephant was developed in part in the Human Brain Project, funded from
the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and
Innovation under Specific Grant Agreements No. 720270, No. 785907 and
No. 945539 (Human Brain Project SGA1, SGA2, and SGA3).}
