%package -n python3-pandas
Summary:        %{summary}

# pandas/_libs/window/aggregations.pyx:
#
#   Moving maximum / minimum code taken from Bottleneck under the terms
#   of its Simplified BSD license
#   https://github.com/pydata/bottleneck
#
# These snippets are extracted from Bottleneck’s internals and cannot be
# replaced by calling the public Bottleneck API, so there is no reasonable path
# to unbundling.
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(bottleneck))

# pandas/_libs/tslibs/parsing.pyx:
#
# Contains a routine, dateutil_parse(), from an unspecified version of dateutil
#
# Cannot be unbundled because the function is forked and compiled as Cython
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(dateutil))

# pandas/_libs/src/klib/khash.h:
#
# From klib (https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib); it is not practical to
# package all of klib separately because it is designed as a copylib, and many
# of its components are not header-only.
Provides:       bundled(klib-khash) = 0.2.6

# pandas/_libs/src/headers/portable.h:
#
# Contains several preprocessor macros from an unspecified version of MUSL libc
#
# Cannot be unbundled because the macros are not directly exposed in the libc
Provides:       bundled(musl-libc)

# pandas/_libs/tslibs/src/datetime/np_datetime.{h,c}:
#
# Derived from Numpy 1.7
#
# Cannot be unbundled because the routines are forked.
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(numpy)) = 1.7

# pandas/util/version/__init__.py:
#
# Vendored from https://github.com/pypa/packaging/blob/main/packaging/_structures.py
# and https://github.com/pypa/packaging/blob/main/packaging/_structures.py
# changeset ae891fd74d6dd4c6063bb04f2faeadaac6fc6313
# 04/30/2021
#
# Cannot be (reasonably) unbundled because the vendored file is not part of
# packaging’s public API.
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(packaging)) = 20.10.dev0^20210430gitae891fd

# pandas/io/clipboard/:
#
# In https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/28471, upstream considered and
# rejected the idea of de-vendoring pyperclip. Furthermore,
# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits/main/pandas/io/clipboard and
# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/commits/main/pandas/io/clipboard/__init__.py
# show that the vendored library has accrued Pandas-specific changes.
#
# Version number from:
# https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/28471/commits/33cd2d72e0c007c460e59105efda9211441b2ce4
# “Updated internal pyperclip 1.5.27 -> 1.7.0”
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(pyperclip)) = 1.7.0

# pandas/_libs/src/parser/tokenizer.c:
#
# Combines some elements from Python's built-in csv module and Warren
# Weckesser's textreader project on GitHub.
#
# Elements from these are both forked and cannot be unbundled. The textreader
# project is a Python extension but is not on PyPI, and is not the same as
# python3dist(textreader).
Provides:       bundled(python3-libs)
Provides:       bundled(textreader)

# scripts/no_bool_in_generic.py:
#
# The function `visit` is adapted from a function by the same name in pyupgrade:
# https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade/blob/5495a248f2165941c5d3b82ac3226ba7ad1fa59d/pyupgrade/_data.py#L70-L113
#
# Not packaged (pre-commit hook) therefore not bundled
# Provides:       bundled(python3dist(pyupgrade)) = 2.11.0^20210201git5495a24

# pandas/io/sas/sas7bdat.py
#
# Based on code written by Jared Hobbs:
#   https://bitbucket.org/jaredhobbs/sas7bdat
#
# Cannot be unbundled because the code is modified, not directly copied
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(sas7bdat))

# pandas/_testing/__init__.py: in _create_missing_idx():
#
#   below is cribbed from scipy.sparse
#
# Cannot be unbundled because only a few lines are copied, not a standalone
# function that we can call
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(scipy))

# pandas/_libs/src/ujson/lib/:
#
# This is a stripped-down copy of UltraJSON. It would be an obvious target for
# unbundling, except:
#
# - Pandas uses the C library API, but UltraJSON upstream does not support
#   building and installing it separately from the Python package.
# - In https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/24711 it is suggested that
#   Pandas might rely on features of the particular vendored version of
#   UltraJSON. It’s not immediately clear whether this is still true or not.
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(ujson))

# pandas/core/accessor.py
#
#   Ported with modifications from xarray
#   https://github.com/pydata/xarray/blob/master/xarray/core/extensions.py
#   1. We don't need to catch and re-raise AttributeErrors as RuntimeErrors
#   2. We use a UserWarning instead of a custom Warning
#
# Cannot be unbundled because the copied code is forked.
Provides:       bundled(python3dist(xarray))
