# This package corresponds to two PyPI projects (sqlmodel-slim, and sqlmodel)
# co-developed in one repository. Since the two are versioned identically and
# released at the same time, it makes sense to build them from a single source

%global common_description %{expand: \
SQLModel is a library for interacting with SQL databases from Python code, with
Python objects. It is designed to be intuitive, easy to use, highly compatible,
and robust.

SQLModel is based on Python type annotations, and powered by Pydantic and
SQLAlchemy.

The key features are:

  • Intuitive to write: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time
    debugging. Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
  • Easy to use: It has sensible defaults and does a lot of work underneath to
    simplify the code you write.
  • Compatible: It is designed to be compatible with FastAPI, Pydantic, and
    SQLAlchemy.
  • Extensible: You have all the power of SQLAlchemy and Pydantic underneath.
  • Short: Minimize code duplication. A single type annotation does a lot of
    work. No need to duplicate models in SQLAlchemy and Pydantic.}
