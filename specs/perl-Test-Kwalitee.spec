%description
Kwalitee is an automatically-measurable gauge of how good your software
is. That's very different from quality, which a computer really can't
measure in a general sense (if you can, you've solved a hard problem in
computer science).

* Thu Jul 18 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.09-1
- Update to 1.09
  - The has_test_pod, has_test_pod_coverage tests have been removed - they are
    classified as 'extra', and have been largely considered to be a bad idea
    anyway (these are often shipped as, and ought to be, in xt/)
  - The extractable test has been removed, as it does nothing in dists before
    there is a tarball present
  - New tests have been added: all standard kwalitee tests that can be run on a
    bare distribution without a tarball
- BR: perl(Capture::Tiny) for test suite

* Tue Jul 16 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.08-1
- Update to 1.08
  - Documentation fixed to reflect which indicators are actually available

    freedom to add and remove metrics

- Bump perl(Test::Builder) version requirement to 0.88

* Sat Jun 29 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.07-1
- Update to 1.07
  - Now the indicators are run in the exact order they are returned from
    Module::CPANTS::Kwalitee::*, as some tests depend on the results of
    earlier tests
  - Synopsis updated to recommend a better way to run this module, ensuring
    that it is not run by cpantesters or at installation time
  - We no longer create a function in our namespace for every metric we are
    going to test; this should not break anyone, as these subs were never
    documented as part of the public API
  - Switch to Module::Build::Tiny flow
- BR: perl(namespace::clean) for module
- Bump version requirement for perl(Test::CheckDeps) to 0.006
- Don't bother with the extra tests (and their requirements) since
  Module::Build::Tiny doesn't provide any convenient method to run them

* Tue May 14 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.06-1
- Update to 1.06
  - Restore previous behaviour of plan()ing in import, to unbreak some dists
    that didn't follow the docs (which in this case is ok since it's a horrible
    idea for a Test module to plan itself anyway) (v1.05)
  - More diagnostic data is printed when a test fails (CPAN RT#85107)
- Drop perl(Test::Builder) version requirement again

* Mon May 13 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.05-1
- Update to 1.05
  - More rigorous testing of output; in order to make this possible, now we do
    END { done_testing } instead of planning a test count
- Bump perl(Test::Builder) version requirement to 0.88
- BR: perl(Test::Deep) and perl(Test::Tester) for the test suite
- Drop buildroot definition and cleaning since this release cannot work on EL-5
  due to the use of done_testing

* Wed May  1 2013 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 1.04-1
- Update to 1.04
  - Fixed documentation to refer to the proper names of Kwalitee tests
    (CPAN RT#24506)
