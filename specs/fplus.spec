%description
FunctionalPlus is a small header-only library supporting you in
reducing code noise and in dealing with only one single level
of abstraction at a time. By increasing brevity and maintainability
of your code it can improve productivity (and fun!) in the long
run. It pursues these goals by providing pure and easy-to-use
functions that free you from implementing commonly used flows of
control over and over again.
