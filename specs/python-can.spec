%description
The Controller Area Network is a bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers
and devices to communicate with each other. It has priority based bus
arbitration, reliable deterministic communication. It is used in cars, trucks,
boats, wheelchairs and more.

The can package provides controller area network support for Python developers;
providing common abstractions to different hardware devices, and a suite of
utilities for sending and receiving messages on a can bus.
