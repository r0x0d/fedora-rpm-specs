# We need to upload a filtered version of the source archive because
# docs/source/examples/lenna.png has several issues, including the lack of a
# license. We have asked upstream to deal with this in
#   Please consider replacing lenna.png
#   https://github.com/G-Node/nixpy/issues/545
# but for now, we must obtain the filtered archive by running the script in
# Source2:
#   ./get_source ${VERSION}
%dnl Source0:    %forgesource
Source0:    nixpy-%{version}-filtered.tar.gz
# The tagged snapshot on GitHub still says "dev" but the manually uploaded
# release does not, so use the info.json from there
# https://github.com/G-Node/nixpy/issues/528
Source1:    info.json
# * Script used to obtain Source0: ./get_source %%{version}
Source2:    get_source

# No need for nix, they're uncoupling it from the C++

%description
The NIX project started as an initiative within the Electrophysiology Task
Force a part of the INCF Data sharing Program. The NIX data model allows to
store fully annotated scientific data-set, i.e. the data together with its
metadata within the same container. Our aim is to achieve standardization by
providing a common/generic data structure for a multitude of data types. See
the wiki for more information

The current implementations store the actual data using the HDF5 file format as
a storage backend.
