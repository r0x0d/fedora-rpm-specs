# Revert test adjustments from 5ccbc62175eece867b498115724eb8d3fa27acb0
# This allows the tests to keep passing with httpx 0.27.x.
#
# Specifically, this reverts:
# https://github.com/encode/starlette/pull/2773/commits/24de2bfc8aa99a084a9b4fcfab1e52d7a6747cd9.
#
# Fixes:
#
# Some tests fail with some supported httpx versions due to whitespace
# differences in JSON responses
# https://github.com/encode/starlette/discussions/2795
#
# We can (and must!) remove this once python-httpx is upgraded to 0.28.x.

# The file requirements.txt pins exact versions and contains many unwanted
# dependencies, e.g. linters and typecheckers (see
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#_linters).
# It’s easier to maintain BuildRequires for testing manually than to heavily
# patch or process the requirements file.

  • In-process background tasks.
  • Startup and shutdown events.
  • Test client built on requests.
  • CORS, GZip, Static Files, Streaming responses.
  • Session and Cookie support.
  • 100%% test coverage.
  • 100%% type annotated codebase.
  • Few hard dependencies.
  • Compatible with asyncio and trio backends.
  • Great overall performance against independent benchmarks.}
