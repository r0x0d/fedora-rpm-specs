%global _description %{expand:
The atlassian-python-api library provides a simple and convenient way to
interact with Atlassian products (such as Jira Service management, Jira
Software, Confluence, Bitbucket and apps Insight, X-Ray) using Python. It is
based on the official REST APIs of these products, as well as additional private
methods and protocols (such as xml+rpc and raw HTTP requests). This library can
be used to automate tasks, integrate with other tools and systems, and build
custom applications that interact with Atlassian products. It supports a wide
range of Atlassian products, including Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, StatusPage
and others, and is compatible with both Atlassian Server and Cloud instances.

Overall, the atlassian-python-api is a useful tool for Python developers who
want to work with Atlassian products. It is well-documented and actively
maintained, and provides a convenient way to access the full range of
functionality offered by the Atlassian REST APIs.}
