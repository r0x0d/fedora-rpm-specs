Release:        %autorelease
Summary:        Python bindings for V-HACD

# The entire source is MIT.
#
# There is supposed to be a bundled copy of the header-only V-HACD library
# (https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/v-hacd,
# https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd) at src/vhacdx/VHACD.h, licensed
# BSD-3-CLause. This file would be present in any archive exported from GitHub,
# but it is currently missing from the PyPI sdist. If the bundled library
# appears, we will remove it in %%prep and use the system copy instead.
#
# Regardless of the above, since v-hacd is a header-only library, it is
# effectively a static library and its BSD-3-Clause license still contributes
# to the license of the binary RPMs even when the system copy is used.
