%global fontdescription  %{expand:
Clear Sans has been recognized as a versatile font for screen, print, and Web.
Its minimized, unambiguous characters and slightly narrow proportions, make it
ideal for UI design.

Clear Sans was designed with on-screen legibility in mind. It strikes a balance
between contemporary, professional, and stylish expression and thoroughly
functional purpose. It has a sophisticated and elegant personality at all
sizes, and its thoughtful design becomes even more evident at the thin weight.}
