%description
CrossReport is a tool to help you analyze the APIs used by a compiled
Linux program, in order to work out the effort required to
cross-compile that program for Windows, using the Fedora MinGW
cross-compiler.

The simplest way to use it is to point it at an existing Linux binary,
and then read the generated report.

What it does in more detail: It looks at the libraries and API calls
used by the Linux binary, and compares them to the libraries and API
calls that we currently support under the Fedora MinGW cross-compiler.
It then works out what is missing, and produces a report suggesting
the amount of work that needs to be done to port the program.  For
example, whether whole libraries need to be ported first, and/or how
to substitute individual calls to work on Windows.
