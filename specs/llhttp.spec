# This package is rather exotic. The compiled library is a typical shared
# library with a C API. However, it has only a tiny bit of C source code. Most
# of the library is written in TypeScript, which is transpiled to C, via LLVM
# IR, using llparse (https://github.com/nodejs/llparse)—all of which happens
# within the NodeJS ecosystem.
#
# The package therefore “builds like” a NodeJS package, and to the extent they
# are relevant we apply the NodeJS packaging guidelines. However, the result of
# the build “installs like” a traditional C library package and has no NodeJS
# dependencies, including bundled ones.
#
# Furthermore, the package is registered with npm as “llhttp”, but current
# releases are not published there, so we use the GitHub archive as the
# canonical source and use a custom bundler script based on
# nodejs-packaging-bundler to fetch NodeJS build dependencies.
#
# Overall, we cherry-pick from the standard and NodeJS packaging guidelines as
# each seems to best apply, understanding that this package does not fit well
# into any of the usual patterns or templates.
#
# Note that there is now a “release” tarball, e.g.
# https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp/archive/refs/tags/release/v%%{version}tar.gz,
# that allows this package to be built without the NodeJS/TypeScript machinery.
# However, the release archive lacks the original TypeScript source code for
# the generated C code, which we would need to include in the source RPM as an
# additional source even if we do not do the re-generation ourselves.

%description
This project is a port of http_parser to TypeScript. llparse is used to
generate the output C source file, which could be compiled and linked with the
embedder's program (like Node.js).
