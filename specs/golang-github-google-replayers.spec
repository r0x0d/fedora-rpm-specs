%global common_description %{expand:
This package contains two tools for testing network clients by recording real
interactions with servers, then playing back the server responses later. These
record/replay proxies let you run an "integration" test that accesses a backend
and record the interaction. Subsequent runs of the test can replay the server's
responses without actually contacting the server, turning the integration test
into a fast and inexpensive unit test.}
