# Downstream-only: Build normal wheels in-place
#
# Upstream wants to build only editable wheels in-place, building normal
# wheels in a temporary directory. This is reasonable in principle, but
# the implementation conflicts with the pyproject-rpm-macros, resulting in
# an unbounded recursion of nested temporary directories.
