# Contains gdb/nonstd_optional_printer.py. We would like to be able to install
# this system-wide so it could be automatically initialized, and there is some
# relevant documentation at
#
# https://sourceware.org/gdb/current/onlinedocs/gdb.html/Writing-a-Pretty_002dPrinter.html
#
# but itâ€™s not quite clear how to correctly tie everything together. Help is
# welcome; until then, we just install the pretty-printer as documentation.
