%description
libInstPatch stands for lib-Instrument-Patch and is a library for processing
digital sample based MIDI instrument “patch” files. The types of files
libInstPatch supports are used for creating instrument sounds for wavetable
synthesis. libInstPatch provides an object framework (based on GObject) to load
patch files into, which can then be edited, converted, compressed and saved.

# We cannot reliably build gtkdoc documentation at the same time as the
# library. It appears that gtkdoc-scangobj attempts to link the library before
# it is built.
#
# The best fix would be to find the missing dependency relationship or other
# problem in the CMake build scripts, but this is not quite obvious.
#
# Historically this could be worked around by setting _smp_ncpus_max to 1, but
# this has stopped working.
#
# Instead, we build with gtkdoc documentation disabled to get the library, then
# enable the gtkdoc documentation and rebuild. This guarantees the library is
# ready when gtkdoc-scangobj runs.
