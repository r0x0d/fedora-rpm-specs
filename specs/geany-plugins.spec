%description common
This package contains some common files which are used by every Geany plugin,
e.g. language translations.


%package addons
Summary:   Miscellaneous Addons for Geany
Requires:  geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}

%description addons
This plugins consists of various small addons too small to justify their own
plugin, but are useful to have. The following functionality is implemented:
* Document list: This addon places a new item in the toolbar and when clicked
  offers a menu listing all open files plus the 'Close All' and 'Close Other
  Documents' menu items. This can be useful to quickly access open files and
  switch to them.
* Open and Copy URI: Adds 'Open URI' and 'Copy URI' menu items to the editor
  menu when the word under the cursor looks like a URI. 'Open URI' uses the
  browser command configured in Geany to open it.
* Tasks: The tasks plugin goes through a file being edited and picks out
  lines with configurable keywords (e.g. "TODO" or "FIXME") in them. It
  collects the text after those words and puts them in a new "Tasks" tab in
  the message window. Clicking on a task in that tab takes you to the line in
  the file where the task was defined.
* Systray: Adds a status icon to the notification area (systray) and provides
  a simple popup menu with some basic actions. It can also be used to
  quickly show and hide the Geany main window.
* Bookmark list: Add a list of defined bookmarks (line markers) to the sidebar.
  This list contains all bookmarks defined in the current file
  for faster overview and access.
* Mark Word: When double-clicking a word, all occurrences of this word are
  searched and then highlighted (similar to Geany's 'Mark All' Find option).
* Strip trailing blank lines: This addon removes excessive trailing blank
  lines from the document when it is saved. If you have 'Ensure new line at
  file end' option checked in Preferences, one trailing newline will be left.
* XML tagging: XML tagging allows to easy tag a selected text, by checking for a
  selection, offering a little dialog for inserting a tag and
  replacing a selection.


%package autoclose
Summary:   Intellectually helps you to write code
Requires:  geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}

access to any action.


%package debugger
Summary:    Enables debugging in Geany
Group:      Development/Tools
Requires:   geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}
Requires:   vte291 >= 0.24
Provides:   geany-plugins-debugger >= 1.36

%package geanyctags
Summary:    Generate and query ctags files for a Geany project
Requires:   geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}
Requires:   ctags

%description geanyctags
Even though Geany supports symbol definition searching by itself within the
open files (and with a plugin support within the whole project), tag
regeneration can become too slow for really big projects. This is why this
plugin was created. It makes it possible to generate the tag file only once and
just query it when searching for a particular symbol definition/declaration.
This approach is fine for big projects where most of the codebase remains
unchanged and the tag positions remain more or less static.


%package geanydoc
Summary:   Call documentation from within Geany
Requires:  geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}

%description geanydoc
Geanydoc allows you to execute specific commands on the word under the cursor.

can either be placed into a special buffer called "DOC" or can be used to
execute an external program. Geanydoc is intended to be used for searching
through API documentation.


%package geanyextrasel

%package geanymacro
Summary:   User defined Macros for Geany
Requires:  geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}

%description geanymacro
GeanyMacro is a plugin to provide user defined macros for Geany. It started
out as part of the ConText feature parity plugin, which was split into
individual plugins to better suit Geany's ethos of being as light as
possible while allowing users to select which features they want to add to
the core editor. The idea was taken from a Text Editor for Windows called
ConText.

This plugin alows you to record and use your own macros. Macros are
sequences of actions that can then be repeated with a single key
combination. So if you had dozens of lines where you wanted to delete the
last 2 characters, you could simple start recording, press End, Backspace,
Backspace, down line and then stop recording. Then simply trigger the macro
and it would automaticaly edit the line and move to the next. You could then
just repeatedly trigger the macro to do as many lines as you want.

* sed commands
* awk script


The output can be:

* the selection of the current document
* all the current document
* or a new document


%package geanynumberedbookmarks
Summary:   Provide users 10 numbered Bookmarks
Requires:  geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}

%description geanynumberedbookmarks
GeanyNumberedBookmarks is a plugin to provide users with 10 numbered
bookmarks (in addition to the usual bookmarks). It started out as part of
the ConText feature parity plugin, which was split into individual plugins
to better suit Geany's ethos of being as light as possible while allowing
users to select which features they want to add to the core editor. The idea
was taken from a Text Editor for Windows called ConText.

Normally if you had more than one bookmark, you would have to cycle through
them until you reached the one you wanted. With this plugin you can go
straight to the bookmark that you want with a single key combination.


%package geanypg

Summary:   Provides an alternate project management tool for Geany
Requires:  geany-plugins-common = %{version}-%{release}

%description geanyprj
Geanyprj provides an alternate project management approach to Geany's built-in
project facility. The idea is to be less a "session manager" as the built-in
project management does: It allows/requires you to manually open and close
project and allows you to store project files in different locations from
project sources.

Geanyprj takes a different approach:
It never saves session information, so that project files can be stored in
version control without constant noise from changes of opened files or cursor
position. You also will never have to open/close projects manually. If a
*.geanyprj file is found somewhere up in path it will be opened automatically.
