# Build and run exhaustive tests?
#
# These really do take a long timeâ€”at least an hour on the fastest machines,
# and over ten hours on s390x (affected also by limited parallelism). Some
# tests cover the entire single-precision domain, about four billion inputs.
# Still, we can finish before we hit any timeouts, and running the exhaustive
# tests brings peace of mind.

%global common_description %{expand:
The fast_float library provides fast header-only implementations for the C++
from_chars functions for float and double types as well as integer types. These
functions convert ASCII strings representing decimal values (e.g., 1.3e10) into
binary types. We provide exact rounding (including round to even). In our
experience, these fast_float functions many times faster than comparable
number-parsing functions from existing C++ standard libraries.}
