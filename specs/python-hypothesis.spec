%global _description %{expand:
Hypothesis is a library for testing your Python code against a much
larger range of examples than you would ever want to write by
hand. It’s based on the Haskell library, Quickcheck, and is designed
to integrate seamlessly into your existing Python unit testing work
flow.}
