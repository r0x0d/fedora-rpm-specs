%description
SLEEF stands for SIMD Library for Evaluating Elementary Functions. It
implements vectorized versions of all C99 real floating point math functions.
It can utilize SIMD instructions that are available on modern processors. SLEEF
is designed to efficiently perform computation with SIMD instructions by
reducing the use of conditional branches and scatter/gather memory access.

The library contains implementations of all C99 real FP math functions in
double precision and single precision. Different accuracy of the results can be
chosen for a subset of the elementary functions; for this subset there are
versions with up to 1 ULP error (which is the maximum error, not the average)
and even faster versions with a few ULPs of error. For non-finite inputs and
outputs, the functions return correct results as specified in the C99 standard.

%description gnuabi
The GNUABI version of the library (libsleefgnuabi.so) is built for x86 and
aarch64 architectures. This library provides an API compatible with libmvec in
glibc, and the API conforms to the x86 vector ABI, AArch64 vector ABI and Power
Vector ABI.

%description dft
SLEEF includes subroutines for discrete Fourier transform(DFT). These
subroutines are fully vectorized, heavily unrolled, and parallelized in such a
way that modern SIMD instructions and multiple cores can be utilized for
efficient computation. It has an API similar to that of FFTW for easy
migration. The subroutines can utilize long vectors up to 2048 bits.

# -DBUILD_INLINE_HEADERS: Do not build the “inline” headers. This would provide

#   well as a static support library, libsleefinline.a, in _libdir. Both the
#   static library and the headers (which are basically a header-only library,
#   and would thus also be treated as a static library in the Fedora
#   guidelines) should be omitted unless something in Fedora absolutely
