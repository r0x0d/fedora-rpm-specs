Summary: Documentation for Django Haystack pluggable search
# Not requiring the main package, as users may wish to install
# the documentation separately.

BuildRequires:  make
BuildRequires:  python3dist(sphinx)
# Those two sphinxcontrib dependencies are pulled by default by upstream Sphinx,
# but in preparation for their separation, we explicitly list them to build
# htmlhelp, json and pickle docs.
# Upstream's tox.ini is not a good place for those, becasue it only builds html.
