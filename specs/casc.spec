# This is a backport of commit 4c094080b7eaccf345dab8d78dde4d75ef51c516 from the
# development branch to the 1.0.5 release.
#
# Support using an external GoogleTest library (#13)
#
# Adds the EXTERNAL_GTEST CMake option, which defaults to OFF, preserving
# the current behavior.
#
# While this is not recommended by the GoogleTest authors, it is useful
# for Linux distribution packaging.

Patch:          casc-1.0.5-external-gtest.patch
# This backports commit 52f105bf7407e90c8bef10cce2a41b7efcb21679, “fix:
# initialize level_count memory”, from the development branch to release 1.0.5.

Patch:          casc-1.0.5-levelcount-memory.patch
# This is a backport of commit 0ea03e39961312986b80eac2c9d259fc525e590e, “fix:
# Stop InnerVisitor from reading past end of array”, from the development
# branch to release 1.0.5.
#
# It fixes upstream issue #14, “Tests fail when libstdc++ assertions are
# enabled” (https://github.com/ctlee/casc/issues/14).

%global common_description %{expand:
CASC is a modern and header-only C++ library which provides a data structure to
represent arbitrary dimension abstract simplicial complexes with user-defined
classes stored directly on the simplices at each dimension. This is achieved by
taking advantage of the combinatorial nature of simplicial complexes and new
C++ code features such as: variadic templates and automatic function return
type deduction. Essentially CASC stores the full topology of the complex
according to a Hasse diagram. The representation of the topology is decoupled
from interactions of user data through the use of metatemplate programming.}
