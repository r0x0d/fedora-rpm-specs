%description
passwdqc is a password/passphrase strength checking and policy
enforcement toolset, including a PAM module (pam_passwdqc), command-line
programs (pwqcheck, pwqfilter, and pwqgen), and a library (libpasswdqc).

pam_passwdqc is normally invoked on password changes by programs such as
passwd(1).  It is capable of checking password or passphrase strength,
enforcing a policy, and offering randomly-generated passphrases, with
all of these features being optional and easily (re-)configurable.

pwqcheck and pwqgen are standalone password/passphrase strength checking
and random passphrase generator programs, respectively, which are usable
from scripts.

The pwqfilter program searches, creates, or updates binary passphrase
filter files, which can also be used with pwqcheck and pam_passwdqc.

libpasswdqc is the underlying library, which may also be used from
third-party programs.

%description -n lib%name
The lib%name is a passphrase strength checking library.
In addition to checking regular passphrases, it offers support
for passphrases and can provide randomly generated passphrases.
All features are optional and can be (re-)configured without
rebuilding.

This package contains shared %name library.

%description -n lib%name-devel
The lib%name is a passphrase strength checking library.
In addition to checking regular passphrases, it offers support
for passphrases and can provide randomly generated passphrases.
All features are optional and can be (re-)configured without
rebuilding.

This package contains development files needed for building
%name-aware applications.

%description -n pam_%name
pam_%name is a passphrase strength checking module for
PAM-aware passphrase changing programs, such as passwd(1).
In addition to checking regular passphrases, it offers support
for passphrases and can provide randomly generated passphrases.
All features are optional and can be (re-)configured without
rebuilding.

%description utils
This package contains standalone utilities which are usable from scripts:
pwqcheck (a standalone passphrase strength checking program),
pwqgen (a standalone random passphrase generator program), and
pwqfilter (a standalone program that searches, creates, or updates
binary passphrase filter files).

- pull in Openwall package

* Fri Oct 31 2003 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com> 0.7.5-owl1
- Assume invocation by root only if both the UID is 0 and the PAM service
  name is "passwd"; this should solve changing expired passwords on Solaris
  and HP-UX and make "enforce=users" safe.
- Produce proper English explanations for a wider variety of settings.
- Moved the "-c" out of CFLAGS, renamed FAKEROOT to DESTDIR.

* Sat Jun 21 2003 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com> 0.7.4-owl1
- Documented that "enforce=users" may not always work for services other
  than the passwd command.
- Applied a patch to PLATFORMS from Mike Gerdts of GE Medical Systems
  to reflect how Solaris 8 patch 108993-18 (or 108994-18 on x86) changes
  Solaris 8's PAM implementation to look like Solaris 9.

* Mon Jun 02 2003 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com> 0.7.3.1-owl1
- Added URL.

* Thu Oct 31 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com> 0.7.3-owl1
- When compiling with gcc, also link with gcc.
- Use $(MAKE) to invoke sub-makes.

* Fri Oct 04 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Solaris 9 notes in PLATFORMS.

* Wed Sep 18 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Build with Sun's C compiler cleanly, from Kevin Steves.
- Use install -c as that actually makes a difference on at least HP-UX
  (otherwise install would possibly move files and not change the owner).

* Fri Sep 13 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Have the same pam_passwdqc binary work for both trusted and non-trusted
  HP-UX, from Kevin Steves.

* Fri Sep 06 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Use bigcrypt() on HP-UX whenever necessary, from Kevin Steves of Atomic
  Gears LLC.
- Moved the old password checking into a separate function.

* Wed Jul 31 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Call it 0.6.

* Sat Jul 27 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Documented that the man page is under the 3-clause BSD-style license.
- HP-UX 11 support.

* Tue Jul 23 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Applied minor corrections to the man page and at the same time eliminated
  unneeded/unimportant differences between it and the README.

* Sun Jul 21 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- 0.5.1: imported the pam_passwdqc(8) manual page back from FreeBSD.

* Tue Apr 16 2002 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- 0.5: preliminary OpenPAM (FreeBSD-current) support in the code and related
code cleanups (thanks to Dag-Erling Smorgrav).

* Thu Feb 07 2002 Michail Litvak <mci@owl.openwall.com>
- Enforce our new spec file conventions.

* Sun Nov 04 2001 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Updated to 0.4:
- Added "ask_oldauthtok" and "check_oldauthtok" as needed for stacking with
the Solaris pam_unix;
- Permit for stacking of more than one instance of this module (no statics).

* Tue Feb 13 2001 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Install the module as mode 755.

* Tue Dec 19 2000 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- Added "-Wall -fPIC" to the CFLAGS.

* Mon Oct 30 2000 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- 0.3: portability fixes (this might build on non-Linux-PAM now).

* Fri Sep 22 2000 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
- 0.2: added "use_authtok", added README.

* Fri Aug 18 2000 Solar Designer <solar@owl.openwall.com>
