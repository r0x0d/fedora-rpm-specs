%changelog
* Mon Sep 30 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.32.3-1

- Resolves: rhbz#2299289

* Sun Sep 15 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.32.2-1
- Explicitly invalidate the global parse hash when a SpecParser instance is created to prevent this issue. (#409)

* Mon Jul 29 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.32.1-1
- Fixed two issues related to condition parsing. (#405)

* Mon Jul 22 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.32.0-1
- It is now possible to bump a release in a manner similar to `rpmdev-bumpspec` using `Specfile.bump_release()` method. (#399)

* Fri Jul 19 2024 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 0.31.0-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_41_Mass_Rebuild

* Tue Jul 09 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.31.0-1
- Value of a `Tag` no longer includes trailing whitespace (if any). (#393)
- specfile now tries to expand macros before processing conditions to be able to resolve conditional expressions defined by macros, for example OpenSUSE Tumbleweed defines `%%ifpython3` macro as `%%if "%%{python_flavor}" == "python3"`. (#394)
- Resolves: rhbz#2294393

* Wed Jun 26 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.30.0-1
- Fixed an exception that occured when accessing the `Specfile.has_autochangelog` property while having unparseable lines (e.g. lines ending with unescaped `%`) in `%%changelog`. (#387)

* Mon Jun 17 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.29.0-1
- Improved compatibility with RPM 4.20 (alpha version is currently in Fedora Rawhide). (#380)
- Resolves: rhbz#2282962

* Sun Jun 09 2024 Python Maint <python-maint@redhat.com> - 0.28.3-2
- Rebuilt for Python 3.13

* Thu May 23 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.28.3-1
- Fixed several minor issues such as processing seemingly commented-out macro definitions (e.g. `#%%global prerel rc1`) and treating `SourceLicense` tag as a source. (#374, #376)
- Made `EVR`, `NEVR` and `NEVRA` objects comparable. (#379)

* Mon Apr 08 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.28.2-1
- Handling of trailing newlines in the macro defintions has been improved. (#361)
- Resolves: rhbz#2271583

* Tue Mar 26 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.28.1-1
- We have fixed an issue in `%%prep` section processing. For instance, if the `%%patches` macro appeared there, it would have been converted to `%%patch es`, causing failure when executing `%%prep` later. (#356)

* Sun Mar 17 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.28.0-1
- A trailing newline is no longer added to spec files without one upon saving. (#353)

* Fri Jan 26 2024 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 0.27.0-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_40_Mass_Rebuild

* Fri Jan 19 2024 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.27.0-1
- Improved handling of commented-out macro definitions and fixed related logic in `Specfile.update_value()`. (#338)

* Mon Nov 20 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.25.0-1
- There is a new method, `Specfile.update_version()`, that allows updating spec file version even if it is a pre-release. (#317)

* Mon Nov 06 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.24.0-1
- Improved type annotations for `UserList` subclasses. (#299)
- Macro definitions gained a new `commented_out` property indicating that a macro definition is commented out. Another new property, `comment_out_style`, determines if it is achieved by using a `%%dnl` (discard next line) directive (e.g. `%%dnl %%global prerelease beta2`) or by replacing the starting `%` with `#` (e.g. `#global prerelease beta2`). (#298)

* Mon Oct 30 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.23.0-1
- Sources now have a `valid` property that indicates whether a source is valid in the current context, meaning it is not present in a false branch of any condition. (#295)

* Fri Oct 06 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.22.1-1
- Removed dependency on setuptools-scm-git-archive. (#290)

* Fri Sep 01 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.22.0-1
- Macro definitions and tags gained a new `valid` attribute. A macro definition/tag is considered valid if it doesn't appear in a false branch of any condition appearing in the spec file. (#276)

* Fri Aug 11 2023 Nikola Forró <nforro@redhat.com> - 0.21.0-1
- `specfile` no longer tracebacks when some sources are missing and can't be _emulated_. In such case the spec file is parsed without them at the cost of `%%setup` and `%%patch` macros potentially expanding differently than with the sources present. (#271)
- Specfile's license in RPM spec file is now confirmed to be SPDX compatible. (#269)

* Mon Jul 31 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.20.2-1
- Fixed Packit config to work properly with `propose-downstream` and `pull-from-upstream` jobs. (#261)

* Fri Jul 21 2023 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 0.20.0-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_39_Mass_Rebuild

* Thu Jul 13 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.20.0-1
- Fixed infinite loop when removing macros with `%` in the name. (#244)
- Added a possibility to undefine system macros by setting a macro value to `None` in the `macros` argument of the `Specfile` constructor. (#244)
- Fixed a bug in processing options of `%%prep` macros. For instance, when a quoted string appeared inside an expression expansion, it could lead to improper parsing, rendering the spec file invalid after accessing the options. (#253)

* Wed Jun 28 2023 Python Maint <python-maint@redhat.com> - 0.19.0-2
- Rebuilt for Python 3.12

* Thu Jun 22 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.19.0-1
- Parsing has been optimized so that even spec files with hundreds of thousands of lines can be processed in reasonable time. (#240)

* Fri May 26 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.18.0-1
- Specfile library now handles multiple `%%changelog` sections. (#230)

* Thu May 11 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.17.0-1
- Added a new `guess_packager()` function that uses similar heuristics as `rpmdev-packager`, meaning that the `Specfile.add_changelog_entry()` method no longer requires `rpmdev-packager` to guess the changelog entry author. (#220)
- The `Specfile.add_changelog_entry()` method now uses dates based on UTC instead of the local timezone. (#223)

* Thu Apr 20 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.16.0-1
- Added `Specfile.has_autorelease` property to detect if a spec file uses the `%%autorelease` macro. (#221)

* Fri Mar 10 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.15.0-1
- Parsing the spec file by RPM is now performed only if really necessary, greatly improving performance in certain scenarios. (#212)
- Checked that license is a valid SPDX license.

* Thu Feb 23 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.14.0-1
- Fixed a bug that broke parsing in case spec file contained conditionalized macro definitions or similar constructs. (#209)
- Specfile no longer depends on rpm-py-installer, it now depends directly on rpm. (#207)

* Mon Jan 30 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.13.2-1
- Fixed infinite loop that occured when section options were followed by whitespace. (#197)

* Mon Jan 23 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.13.1-1
- Fixed a bug in section parsing that caused sections to be ignored when there were macro definitions spread across the spec file and not cumulated at the top. (#191)

* Fri Jan 20 2023 Fedora Release Engineering <releng@fedoraproject.org> - 0.13.0-2
- Rebuilt for https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_38_Mass_Rebuild

* Fri Jan 20 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.13.0-1
- Added `Section.options` attribute for convenient manipulation of section options. (#183)
- specfile now supports single-line sections where section content is represented by a macro starting with a newline. (#182)
- Added `evr` argument to `Specfile.add_changelog_entry()`. This allows adding a changelog entry with an EVR value that's different from the current specfile's value. This makes it easier to reconstruct a specfile's `%changelog` based on another source using the higher level interface. (#181)

* Fri Jan 06 2023 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.12.0-1
- All classes including `Specfile` itself can now be copied using the standard `copy()` and `deepcopy()` functions from `copy` module. (#176)
- `Section.name` attribute has been renamed to a more fitting `Section.id`. (#167)
- `setup.cfg` now uses `license_files` instead of deprecated `license_file`. (#162)

* Wed Dec 14 2022 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.11.1-1
- Tags enclosed in conditional macro expansions are not ignored anymore. (#156)
- Fixed context managers being shared between Specfile instances. (#157)

* Fri Dec 09 2022 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.11.0-1
- Context managers (`Specfile.sections()`, `Specfile.tags()` etc.) can now be nested and combined together (with one exception - `Specfile.macro_definitions()`), and it is also possible to use tag properties (e.g. `Specfile.version`, `Specfile.license`) inside them. It is also possible to access the data directly, avoiding the `with` statement, by using the `content` property (e.g. `Specfile.tags().content`), but be aware that no modifications done to such data will be preserved. You must use `with` to make changes. (#153)

* Wed Nov 30 2022 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.10.0-1
- Fixed an issue that caused empty lines originally inside changelog entries to appear at the end. (#140)
- Renamed the `ignore_missing_includes` option to a more general `force_parse`. If specified, it allows to attempt to parse the spec file even if one or more sources required to be present at parsing time are not available. Such sources include sources referenced from shell expansions in tag values and sources included using the `%include` directive. (#137)

* Sat Nov 12 2022 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.9.1-1
- `specfile` now supports localized tags (e.g. `Summary(fr)`) and tags with qualifiers (e.g. `Requires(post)`).
  It also follows more closely rpm parsing logic and doesn't fail on invalid section names. (#132)

* Tue Oct 25 2022 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.9.0-1
- Added utility classes for working with (N)EVR. (#113)
- Fixed an issue with multiple instances of `Specfile` not expanding macros in the right context. (#117)

* Fri Oct 14 2022 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.8.0-1
- Added `Specfile.update_tag()` method that allows updating tag values while trying to preserve macro expansions. You can watch a demo on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/yzMfBPdFXZY). (#101)

* Fri Oct 07 2022 Packit <hello@packit.dev> - 0.7.0-1
- It is now possible to filter changelog entries by specifying lower bound EVR, upper bound EVR or both. (#104)
- Added support for filenames specified in source URL fragments, for example: `https://example.com/foo/1.0/download.cgi#/%{name}-%{version}.tar.gz` (#100)
