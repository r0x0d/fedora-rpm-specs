# Note that this package, like other aspell's language packs, does not come up
# cleanly through rpmlint, but with the following errors:
# E: aspell-ml no-binary
# E: aspell-ml only-non-binary-in-usr-lib
# This is because the package contains only data files which sit under /usr/lib.
# They have to stay there, as they are architecture-dependent (due to
# byte-ordering issues).
# E: aspell-ml configure-without-libdir-spec
#  The configure script isn't actually one generated by autoconf and doesn't accept
#  --libdir, so this error is bogus.
