%global _desc %{expand:
SoPlex is an optimization package for solving linear programming
problems (LPs) based on an advanced implementation of the primal and
dual revised simplex algorithm.  It provides special support for the
exact solution of LPs with rational input data.  It can be used as a
standalone solver reading MPS or LP format files via a command line
interface as well as embedded into other programs via a C++ class
library.  The main features of SoPlex are:

- presolving, scaling, exploitation of sparsity, hot-starting from any
  regular basis,
- column- and row-oriented form of the simplex algorithm,
- an object-oriented software design written in C++,
- a compile-time option to use 80bit extended ("quad") precision for
  numerically difficult LPs,
- an LP iterative refinement procedure to compute high-precision
  solution, and
- routines for an exact rational LU factorization and continued fraction
  approximations in order to compute exact solutions.

SoPlex has been used in numerous research and industry projects and is
the standard LP solver linked to the mixed-integer nonlinear programming
and constraint integer programming solver SCIP.}
