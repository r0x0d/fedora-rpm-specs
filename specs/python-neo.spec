# downloads LARGE amounts of test data so must be run with network enabled in mock:
# --with=tests --enable-network
# Note: all tests pass, they just take a lot of bandwidth and time.
# 5 tests do not pass because we do not have sonpy in the repos yet.

%global _description %{expand:
Neo is a package for representing electrophysiology data in Python, together
with support for reading a wide range of neurophysiology file formats,
including Spike2, NeuroExplorer, AlphaOmega, Axon, Blackrock, Plexon, Tdt, and
support for writing to a subset of these formats plus non-proprietary formats
including HDF5.

The goal of Neo is to improve interoperability between Python tools for
analyzing, visualizing and generating electrophysiology data (such as
OpenElectrophy, NeuroTools, G-node, Helmholtz, PyNN) by providing a common,
shared object model. In order to be as lightweight a dependency as possible,
Neo is deliberately limited to representation of data, with no functions for
data analysis or visualization.

Neo implements a hierarchical data model well adapted to intracellular and
extracellular electrophysiology and EEG data with support for multi-electrodes
(for example tetrodes). Neos data objects build on the quantities_ package,
which in turn builds on NumPy by adding support for physical dimensions. Thus
neo objects behave just like normal NumPy arrays, but with additional metadata,
checks for dimensional consistency and automatic unit conversion.
