%global common_description %{expand:
Fmidi is a library to read and play back MIDI files. It supports both standard
MIDI files and RIFF MIDI files.

The functionality is exposed as a C programming interface, and it is
implemented with C++.

It is a simple library which is good for implementing a MIDI file player, or
any program taking MIDI files as inputs. In fact, a player with a terminal
interface is provided as an example.}
