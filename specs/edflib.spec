#     binaries built from these sources are not installed; therefore these

#     link these sources are for testing only and are not installed; therefore

# As of 1.26, we have switched to packaging from the automatic GitLab source
# archive instead; for 1.26, the release archive at:
#   %%global tar_version %%(echo '%%{version}' | tr -d .)
#   Source:         https://www.teuniz.net/edflib/edflib_%%{tar_version}.tar.gz
# lacked the lib/ subdirectory containing the Makefile, and had some other cruft
# in a tmp/ directory, indicating an error-prone manual release process.

# Library makefile: make more amenable to distribution packaging

# This PR seems to have languished upstream; rebased locally on 1.26:
Patch:          edflib-1.26-makefile.patch

# Big-endian support was proposed upstream, but a patch was declined, and
# beginning with version 1.23, “non-support” of big-endian architectures is
# explicitly documented and enforced at runtime. See the linked issue:
#
# edflib does not support big-endian architectures
