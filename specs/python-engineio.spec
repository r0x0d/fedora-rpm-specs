%global common_description %{expand:
Engine.IO is a lightweight transport protocol that enables real-time
bidirectional event-based communication between clients (typically, though not
always, web browsers) and a server. The official implementations of the client
and server components are written in JavaScript. This package provides Python
implementations of both, each with standard and asyncio variants.}

# Since we may skip some tests, let’s do a “smoke test” for completeness. We
# omit the async drivers for eventlet (retired in Fedora 41 and later), gevent,
# and uwsgi, since there are no integration tests for them and they are not
# otherwise BuildRequires, and we don’t want to add them solely for this
# purpose.
