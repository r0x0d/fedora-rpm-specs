%global _description %{expand:
Shapely is a package for creation, manipulation, and analysis of planar
geometry objects – designed especially for developers of cutting edge
geographic information systems. In a nutshell: Shapely lets you do PostGIS-ish
stuff outside the context of a database using idiomatic Python.

You can use this package with python-matplotlib and numpy. See README.rst for
more information!}

# The [vectorized] extra has gone away in Shapely 2.0. We Provide the name of
# the old vectorized extra metapackage since vectorized implementations are
# always compiled in the base package, but we do not attempt to Provide
# python3dist(shapely[vectorized]) etc.
%py_provides python3-shapely+vectorized
Obsoletes:      python3-shapely+vectorized < 2.0.0-1

# We used to build PDF documentation in a separate subpackage. The PyPI sdist
# lacks necessary files, like docs/conf.py, but the GitHub archive lacks the
# proper released shapely/_version.py, so if we use it, we need to create a tag
# in a local git repository to get the right version number in the dist-info
# metadata. We find that the PDF documentation is not worth all that hassle!
Obsoletes:      python-shapely-doc < 2.0.0-1

# The file src/kvec.h comes from klib
# (https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib), which is intended to be used as a
# collection of mostly-independent “copylib” components.
Provides:       bundled(klib-kvec) = 0.1.0
