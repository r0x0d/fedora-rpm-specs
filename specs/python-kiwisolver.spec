%global _description %{expand:
Kiwi is an efficient C++ implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving
algorithm. Kiwi is an implementation of the algorithm based on the seminal
Cassowary paper. It is *not* a refactoring of the original C++ solver. Kiwi has
been designed from the ground up to be lightweight and fast.}

Summary:        %{summary}

# The file kiwi/AssocVector.h is derived from Loki
# (https://sourceforge.net/projects/loki-lib/,
# https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/loki-lib [retired]).
#
# Because this file has been modified from the original, and because Loki
# upstream is no longer active, it cannot be unbundled. It is not
# straightforward to determine which version of Loki was used for the fork.
