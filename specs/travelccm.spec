%description
%{name} aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding
C++ implementation, for choosing one item among a set of travel
solutions, given demand-related characteristics (e.g.,
Willingness-To-Pay, preferred airline, preferred cabin, etc.).

The %{name} C++ library implements some simple Customer Choice Models
(CCM), as referenced in the literature (PhD dissertations at MIT, for
instance: https://dspace.mit.edu).

The %{name} C++ library exposes a simple, clean and object-oriented,
API. For instance, the choose() method takes, as input, both a
structure representing the travel request (e.g., "from Washington, DC,
US, to Beijing, China, on the 25th of May") and a list of travel
solutions (as provided by the Airline Travel Solution Provider (AirTSP)
project: https://github.com/airsim/airtsp), and yields, as output, the
chosen item.

The output can then be used by other systems, for instance to book the
corresponding travel or to visualize it on a map and calendar and to
share it with others.

%{name} makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: https://www.boost.org) library is used.

Install the %{name} package if you need a library of basic C++ objects
for Customer-Choice Modeling (CCM), mainly for simulation purpose.
