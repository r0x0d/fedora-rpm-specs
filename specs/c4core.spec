%global common_description %{expand:
c4core is a library of low-level C++ utilities, written with low-latency
projects in mind.

Some of the utilities provided by c4core have already equivalent functionality
in the C++ standard, but they are provided as the existing C++ equivalent may
be insufficient (e.g., std::string_view), inefficient (e.g., std::string),
heavy (e.g. streams), or plainly unusable on some platforms/projects, (e.g.
exceptions); some other utilities have equivalent under consideration for C++
standardization; and yet some other utilities have (to the author’s knowledge)
no equivalent under consideration.}

# Each of these header-only libraries is made available under c4/ext/… in the
# API of this package. Dependent packages that use them should really have
# BuildRequires on the corresponding -static packages for header-only package
# tracking.
Requires:       debugbreak-devel
Requires:       fast_float-devel

# The bundled copy was forked from the original header-only library published
# as a gist at
# https://gist.github.com/Leandros/6dc334c22db135b033b57e9ee0311553 (see also
# the blog post at https://arvid.io/2018/07/02/better-cxx-prng/). The original
# was never versioned, but only one revision was ever published, so we can
# infer the commit hash (6dc334c22db135b033b57e9ee0311553) from which the
# bundled copy was forked and assign a snapshot version.

# is not currently suitable to be packaged in its entirety—if nothing else, due

# bundled here, https://github.com/WG21-SG14/SG14/issues/163.
