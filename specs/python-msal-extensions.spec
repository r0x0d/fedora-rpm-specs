# Downstream-only: restore hard dependency on pygobject
#
# Upstream omitted this dependency because they were not confident they could
# successfully "pip install" it, but we have no such difficulty with system
# packages. It is a real dependency for msal_extensions/libsecret.py.

# and if it is not installed, it would not have been usable anyway (e.g.
# because the OS installation is "headless").

%global _description %{expand:
The Microsoft Authentication Extensions for Python offers secure mechanisms for
client applications to perform cross-platform token cache serialization and
persistence. It gives additional support to the Microsoft Authentication Library
for Python (MSAL).

MSAL Python supports an in-memory cache by default and provides the
SerializableTokenCache to perform cache serialization. You can read more about
this in the MSAL Python documentation. Developers are required to implement
their own cache persistence across multiple platforms and Microsoft
Authentication Extensions makes this simpler.}
