%description
libConfuse is a configuration file parser library, licensed under
the terms of the ISC license, and written in C. It supports
sections and (lists of) values (strings, integers, floats,
booleans or other sections), as well as some other features (such
as single/double-quoted strings, environment variable expansion,
functions and nested include statements). It makes it very
easy to add configuration file capability to a program using
a simple API.

The goal of libConfuse is not to be the configuration file parser
library with a gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be
easy to use and quick to integrate with your code.
