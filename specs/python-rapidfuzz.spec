%global _description %{expand:
RapidFuzz is a fast string matching library for Python and C++, which is using
the string similarity calculations from FuzzyWuzzy. However there are a couple
of aspects that set RapidFuzz apart from FuzzyWuzzy:
- It is MIT licensed so it can be used whichever License you might want
to choose for your project, while you're forced to adopt the GPL license when
using FuzzyWuzzy
- It provides many string_metrics like hamming or jaro_winkler, which
are not included in FuzzyWuzzy
- It is mostly written in C++ and on top of this comes with a lot of Algorithmic
improvements to make string matching even faster, while still providing the same
results. For detailed benchmarks check the documentation
- Fixes multiple bugs in the partial_ratio implementation}
