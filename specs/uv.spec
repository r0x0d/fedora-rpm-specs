# On some releases and architectures, Koji builders sometimes or always run out
# of memory in the final linking step. This cannot be fixed by adding
# "-C link-args=-Wl,--no-keep-memory" to the RUSTFLAGS (as that seems to have
# no significant effect on memory requirements), nor can it be fixed by
# reducing parallelism with e.g. the %%constrain_build macro (although we do
# need this as well), since nothing else is happening at that point in the
# build. See:
# https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#debuginfo
%global rustflags_debuginfo 1

# As a separate limitation, memory exhaustion can occur on builders with very
# many CPUs. Typical workspace crates peak out at 2-4 GB per rustc invocation.
# The uv crate needs much more memory to compile (see the RUSTFLAGS adjustment
# in %%build), but in practice it is also compiled alone after all the other
# crates have finished, so it does not need to influence (and does not benefit
# from) this setting. Even though some crates will require more than 3GB, the
# average should be below that on many-core systems. Increase as needed.

# Downstream-only: do not override the default allocator
#
# In https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/pull/399, it was reasonably claimed that
# using tikv-jemallocator improved benchmarks by 10%. However, this would
# require packaging at least the tikv-jemalloc-sys, tikv-jemalloc-ctl, and
# tikv-jemallocator crates, and this is expected to be not quite trivial.
# We use the default allocator for now, and reserve tikv-jemallocaator
# packaging as optional future work.

# Downstream-only: use the zlib-ng backend for flate2 on all architectures
#
# Upstream excludes s390x and ppc64le because there are issues with the

# platforms, but we have no such issues because we always link the system
# zlib-ng, which works fine on these architectures.

# Downstream-only: do not attempt to run doctests from README.md
#
# This patch is copied from the rust-reqwest-middleware package. It is

# it turns out that running doctests would also require the reqwest-tracing
# crate, which we do not bundle (and is, as of this writing, not separately
# packaged), so the patch is needed here as well.

# the commit message of which helps explain the rationale. In part:
#
#   The architecture of uv does not necessarily match that of the python
#   interpreter. In cross compiling/testing scenarios the operating system can
#   also mismatch. To solve this, we move arch and os detection to python,
#   vendoring the relevant pypa/packaging code, preventing mismatches between
#   what the python interpreter was compiled for and what uv was compiled for.
#
# We cannot use the system package directly because these Python sources are
# compiled into the uv executable, and the binary package does not even depend
# on the system Python interpreter. Patching uv to read the sources from the
# system package at runtime would be much too extreme for a downstream change.
# Copying sources from the system package into the build tree is feasible, but
# – especially considering that the sources are not necessarily executed with
# the system Python interpreter – the risks of deviating from upstream’s tested
# sources would seem to greatly outweigh any possible benefits of such
# “build-time unbundling.” We therefore consider this instance of bundling
# technically necessary. See also:
#   https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/5588#issuecomment-2257474140

%global common_description %{expand:
An extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust.
Designed as a drop-in replacement for common pip and pip-tools workflows.

Highlights:

  • ⚖️ Drop-in replacement for common pip, pip-tools, and virtualenv commands.
  • ⚡️ 10-100x faster than pip and pip-tools (pip-compile and pip-sync).
  • 💾 Disk-space efficient, with a global cache for dependency deduplication.
  • 🐍 Installable via curl, pip, pipx, etc. uv is a static binary that can be
    installed without Rust or Python.
  • 🧪 Tested at-scale against the top 10,000 PyPI packages.
  • 🖥️ Support for macOS, Linux, and Windows.
  • 🧰 Advanced features such as dependency version overrides and alternative
    resolution strategies.
  • ⁉️ Best-in-class error messages with a conflict-tracking resolver.
  • 🤝 Support for a wide range of advanced pip features, including editable
    installs, Git dependencies, direct URL dependencies, local dependencies,
    constraints, source distributions, HTML and JSON indexes, and more.}
