# Note that upstream is dead; GNOME still offers just a download page, and the
# VCS was migrated to https://gitlab.gnome.org/Archive/libidl, but the project
# is archived and therefore no bug tracker is offered. An old email address for
# the ORBIT development mailing list is offered in the HACKING file, but the
# archived status of the project shows that nothing will be done with patches.
# Any patches below will therefore not be sent upstream, because there is
# nowhere for them to go.
#
# Normally this would be the time to re-evaluate whether the package still
# belongs in Fedora, but ORBit2 still requires it, and at least libgnome and
# libbonobo require that, so it is in the dependency chain of a great many
# packages.

# Fix paths reported by the libIDL-config-2 tool to conform with Fedora
# multilib installation paths:
Patch:          libIDL-0.8.6-multilib.patch
# Remove an unused parent-node variable in the primary_expr part of the parser,
# which caused a compiler warning.
Patch:          libIDL-0.8.14-parser-primary_expr-unused-parent-node.patch
# On platforms (such as 64-bit Linux), where long long int and long int are
# both 64-bit, we can have IDL_LL defined to ll (format with %%lld) while
# IDL_longlong_t, which is just gint64, may be ultimately defined to long int.
# This results in compiler warnings about the mismatch between the long long
# format and long parameter, even though the types are compatible. We can fix
# this with a cast to (long long) before formatting.
Patch:          libIDL-0.8.14-long-long-format-warnings.patch
# Instead of type-punning with sscanf, parse into a temporary with a type
# matching the format code and then memmove into the “integer” storage. This is
# no less platform-dependent, but does not invoke undefined behavior or produce
# a compiler warning.
Patch:          libIDL-0.8.14-lexer-sscanf-type-punning.patch
# Fix references to the old libIDL-config script by changing them to
# libIDL-config-2.
Patch:          libIDL-0.8.14-old-libIDL-config-script.patch
