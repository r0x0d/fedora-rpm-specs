Name:           python-zmq
Version:        26.2.0
Release:        %autorelease
Summary:        Python bindings for zeromq

# As noted in https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq/blob/v26.2.0/RELICENSE/README.md:
#   pyzmq starting with 26.0.0 is fully licensed under the 3-clause Modified
#   BSD License. A small part of the core (Cython backend only) was previously
#   licensed under LGPLv3 for historical reasons. Permission has been granted
#   by the contributors of the vast majority of those components to relicense
#   under MPLv2 or BSD. This backend has been completely replaced in pyzmq 26,
#   and the new implementation is fully licensed under BSD-3-Clause, so pyzmq
#   is now under a single license.
# Nevertheless:
#   - zmq/ssh/forward.py, which is derived from a Paramiko demo, is
#     LGPL-2.1-or-later
#   - zmq/eventloop/zmqstream.py is Apache-2.0

                LGPL-2.1-or-later AND
                Apache-2.0
                }
# Additionally, the following do not affect the license of the binary RPMs:
#   - tools/run_with_env.cmd is CC0-1.0; for distribution in the source RPM, it
#     is covered by “Existing uses of CC0-1.0 on code files in Fedora packages
#     prior to 2022-08-01, and subsequent upstream versions of those files in
#     those packages, continue to be allowed. We encourage Fedora package
#     maintainers to ask upstreams to relicense such files.”
#     https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/91#note_1151947383
#   - examples/device/device.py and examples/win32-interrupt/display.py are
#     LicenseRef-Fedora-Public-Domain; approved in “Review of
#     python-zmq examples dedicated to the public domain,”
#     https://gitlab.com/fedora/legal/fedora-license-data/-/issues/616; see

# Beginning with Fedora 42, the binary packages are renamed from
# python3-zmq/python3-zmq-tests to python3-pyzmq/python3-pyzmq-tests to match
# the canonical package name. Ideally, the source package would also be called
# python-pyzmq, but it’s not worth going through the package renaming process
# for this. The Obsoletes/Conflicts provide a clean upgrade path, and can be
# removed after Fedora 44 end-of-life.

# Beginning with Fedora 42 and python-zmq 26, the tests are moved out of the
