# Fedora-specific patches:
# Patch makefile to handle of CC, CFLAGS, install directory variables per
# Fedora packaging spec, and to not install gkermit.txt as that will be
# handled as a doc file.
# and 
Patch0:         gkermit-1.00-makefile.patch

# Patch to use stdlib.h, string.h, and unistd.h headers, rather than
# assuming the argument profiles of various standard library functions.
Patch1:         gkermit-1.00-std_headers.patch

# NOT patching incorrect FSF address as reported by rpmlint.  As of
# 14-JUL-2012, policy states that only upstream notification is required.
# Upstream was notified by email on 14-JUL-2012, and a reply was received
# the same day stating that the address will not be changed.

%description
G-Kermit is a utility for file transfer using the Kermit protocol,
supporting text and binary transfers on 7-bit and 8-bit connections.
It is most useful as a remote endpoint; for a more fully-featured Kermit
program, use the ckermit package.
