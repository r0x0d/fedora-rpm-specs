# If we switched to the GitHub archive from the PyPI sdist, we could add a
# CITATION.bib file, a demos/ directory, and Sphinx-generated documentation;
# however, we consider this not worthwhile, especially since the demos are so
# large that it is doubtful whether it is worth packaging them.

# The package is arched so that the BR and weak dependency on python-torch can
# be conditionalized. It does not contain compiled machine code, so there are
