# Downstream-only: add an SONAME version
#
# Upstream was asked about .so versioning and setting SONAME properly and
# seemed unprepared to handle the request:
# https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1259#issuecomment-657120216
#
# A patch was offered:
# https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1387
# but it was not sufficient for the general case, since (1) it only handled the
# monolithic build, and (2) it derived the .so version from PXR_MAJOR_VERSION,
# which is *not* reliably bumped on API or ABI changes, and currently is still
# zero.
#
# We will therefore probably need to keep doing downstream .so versioning for
# the foreseeable future. Currently we are assuming that the ABI is likely to
# change on every release (an appropriate assumption for a large C++ project
# with no ABI stability policy), so we build the .so version from the project
# version. Note that the “hidden” major version is zero, so this complies with
# the “0.” prefix recommended in the packaging guidelines.
#
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/#_downstream_so_name_versioning
#
# A known defect of this patch is that it causes the hdTiny.so example plugin
# to be versioned as well, which is undesired. This is not a serious problem
# because we do not want to package the built plugin anyway. (It should not be
# built with -DPXR_BUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF, but it is.)

Summary:        Universal Scene Description library

# Filed ticket to convince upstream to use system libraries
#   Use system libraries instead of bundling them when possible
#   https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/USD/issues/1490
# See also:
#   Path to using external/system copies of OpenEXRCore and libdeflate?
#   https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenUSD/issues/2619
# Version from: pxr/base/gf/ilmbase_half.README
#
# This is difficult to unbundle even in the manner of double-conversion: code
# that uses the half type is compatible with ilmbase version 2 (as packaged in
# openexr2) rather than version 3 (as packaged in the ilmbase package).
# Unfortunately, we need cmake(Imath) elsewhere in the package, and this comes
# from the imath package (version 3), which conflicts with the imath version 2
# libraries included with openexr2. So this will not be possible until the
# surrounding code is patched (upstream or downstream) for compatibility with
# ilmbase version 3, something we’re currently not willing to attempt.
Provides:       bundled(ilmbase) = 2.5.3
# Version from: pxr/base/pegtl/pegtl/version.hpp
# Currently, Fedora’s PEGTL is too old:
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1902427
Provides:       bundled(PEGTL) = 3.2.7
# Version from pxr/imaging/hio/OpenEXR/OpenEXRCore/openexr_version.h
# From pxr/imaging/hio/OpenEXR/README.md:
#   A few changes are still in progress to upstreamed to the OpenEXR project,
#   but these are minor, and otherwise, almost all differences between the
#   interred OpenEXRCore and the official OpenEXR repo are consolidated to the
#   openexr_conf.h header. The remaining differences are removing an extern
#   marking from the few global data tables.
# This suggests that it may not be entirely safe to unbundle this.
Provides:       bundled(openexr) = 3.2.0
# Version from the message for the commit
# e7a8d718c7c113e1c653ee31dc52421f17e09b42 that introduced pxr/external/boost/:
#
#   python: Initial import of boost::python from boost 1.85.0
#   This change just brings boost::python into the tree as a starting point for
#   the pxr_boost::python implementation. The src/ and test/ directories are
#   placed next to the public headers since we don't have separate
#   public/private directory hierarchies like boost, but the code itself is
#   unchanged and not included in the build.
#
#   We use boost 1.85.0 as the starting point even though we're currently on
#   VFX Reference Platform 2022, which specifies boost 1.76.0. This is because
#   later versions of boost are needed for other platforms and versions of
#   Python that OpenUSD supports. For example Python 3.11 requires boost
#   1.82.0+.
#
# This is not a candidate for unbundling because upstream has explicitly forked
# boost::python and modified it to work without the rest of Boost as part of an
# effort to remove the Boost dependency. While pxr_boost::python is derived
# from boost::python, it is not intended to remain compatible with it.
Provides:       bundled(boost) = 1.85.0

# We are currently able to unbundle these and use system libraries, but we
# retain the virtual Provides, commented out, as documentation and in case we
# ever have to switch back to the bundled versions.
#
# Version from: pxr/base/tf/pxrDoubleConversion/README
# Provides:       bundled(double-conversion) = 3.3.0
# Version from: pxr/base/tf/pxrLZ4/lz4.h (LZ4_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR_PATCH})
# Provides:       bundled(lz4) = 1.9.2

# Provides:       bundled(pugixml) = 1.9
# Version from: pxr/base/js/rapidjson/rapidjson.h
# (RAPIDJSON_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH}_VERSION)
# Provides:       bundled(rapidjson) = 1.1.0
# Version from: pxr/base/tf/pxrTslRobinMap/robin_growth_policy.h

# Provides:       bundled(libdeflate) = 1.18
# Version from pxr/imaging/plugin/hioAvif/AVIF/src/avif/avif.h
#   We actually have a post-release snapshot of libavif, because
#   AVIF_VERSION_DEVEL is nonzero, but it’s not easy to determine which commit
#   hash it was copied from.
# Provides:       bundled(libavif) = 1.0.1
# Version from pxr/imaging/plugin/hioAvif/AVIF/src/src-libyuv/libyuv/version.h
# LIBYUV_VERSION is a “serial number” version, e.g. 1895, that gets incremented
# every time changes are dumped into git from an internal VCS; the libyuv
# package in Fedora is considered to have version 0 and uses snapshot
# versioning. We can dig through
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/libyuv/libyuv and find the commit hash that
# corresponds to a particular serial number.
# LIBYUV_VERSION 1895 = commit a97746349b244efd54ab1eb0c0a7366717b33f39

# While headers normally go in -devel packages, those in

# for generated code), and it makes sense to package them with the rest of the
# library resources. (Technically, these are currently used only by the
# usdGenSchema command-line tool, so they could be moved to the base package,
# but this is probably too fussy.)
