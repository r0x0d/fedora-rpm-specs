%global _description %{expand:
pyunicorn (Unified Complex Network and RecurreNce analysis toolbox)
is a fully object-oriented Python package for the advanced
analysis and modeling of complex networks. Above the standard measures
of complex network theory such as degree, betweenness and clustering 
coefficient it provides some uncommon but interesting statistics like 
Newman's random walk betweenness. pyunicorn features novel node-weighted
(node splitting invariant) network statistics as well as measures 
designed for analyzing networks of interacting/interdependent networks.}
