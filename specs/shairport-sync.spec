%description
Shairport Sync emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of streaming audio
 from iTunes, iPods, iPhones, iPads and AppleTVs. Audio played by a Shairport
 Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and hence with similar
 devices playing the same source. Thus, for example, synchronised multi-room
 audio is possible without difficulty. (Hence the name Shairport Sync, BTW.)

Shairport Sync does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.

- New upstream release
- In recent versions of iOS (11.2) and mac OS (10.13.2), when play
  is resumed after a pause, the volume level is not always restored,
  and, if software volume control is being used, Shairport Sync plays
  at full volume. This issue has been addressed by storing the last
  airplay volume setting when a play session ends and using it as a
  default when a new play session begins.
- Better AirPlay synchronisation. Older versions of Shairport Sync
  added an 11,025 frame (0.25 seconds) offset to all the latencies
  negotiated with the sender. This seems now only to be correct for
  iTunes and ForkedDaapd sources, but incorrect for AirPlay sources.
  Accordingly, the offset is only added for iTunes and ForkedDaapd.
  The result is better sync with videos, e.g, YouTube, while iTunes
  and ForkedDaapd synchronisation is unaffected.
- A bug in the hardware volume control affected output devices that
  have hardware mixers but that do not allow the volume to be set in dB.
  One example is the Softvol plugin in ALSA. Shairport Sync failed
  silently when presented with such a device when hardware volume
  control is enabled: the volume events have no effect. The bug has been
  fixed by adding two missing lines of code to the init() function in
  audio_alsa.c. Thanks to Jakub Nabaglo for finding and fixing the bug.
- A number of bug fixes due to belboj. Many thanks for these!
- Enhancements to the handling of quit requests by threads, thanks(again) to belboj!
* Wed Sep 13 2017 Bill Peck <bpeck@redhat.com> 3.1.2-1
- New upstream release
- The default value for the alsa setting mute_using_playback_switch has
  been changed to "no" for compatability with other audio players on the
  same machine. Because of this you may need to unmute your audio device
  if you are upgrading from an older release.
- Fixed bugs that made Shairport Sync drop out or become unavailable when
  playing YouTube videos, SoundCloud streams etc. from the Mac.
* Sun Aug 20 2017 Bill Peck <bpeck@redhat.com> 3.1.1-1
- A bug in the sndio backend has been fixed that caused problems on some
  versions of Linux.
- A change has been made to how Shairport Sync responds to a TEARDOWN request,
  which should make it respond better to sequences of rapid termination and
  restarting of play sessions. This can happen, for example, playing YouTube
  videos in Safari or Chrome on a Mac.
- Choosing soxr interpolation in the configuration file will now cause
  Shairport Sync to terminate with a message if Shairport Sync has not been
  compiled with SoX support.
- Other small changes.
* Thu Aug 17 2017 Bill Peck <bpeck@redhat.com> 3.1-1
