%description
This script tries to export SSH public keys to specified sites.
It will walk the user through generating key pairs if it doesn't
find any to export.  It handles all the fiddly details, like
remembering the SSH key file names, updating the authorized_keys
and making sure local and remote permissions are correct.
It tells you what it's doing if it has to change anything.
