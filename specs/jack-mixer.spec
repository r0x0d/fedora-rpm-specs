%description
jack_mixer is an audio mixer for JACK with a look similar to its hardware
counterparts. Many features are available, here is a short list:

 - Mix any number of input channels (mono or stereo).
 - Control balance and faders with MIDI commands.
 - Handle session management with LASH.
 - Create as many outputs as necessary.
 - Quickly monitor inputs (PFL) and outputs.

- New upstream release
- Changes to channel fader/meter layout and features:
  - Added K20 and K14 scales.
  - Added tick marks for left/center/right on balance slider and add tooltip
    displaying left/right value.
  - Added maximum width for control group labels. Labels are ellipsized if too
    long and a tooltip with the full name is added.
- Channel add/property dialogs usability improvements:
  - Remember last used settings for new input/outut channel dialogs (MIDI CCs
    are always initialized with -1 by default, so they can be auto-assigned).
  - Channel name is pre-filled in with "Input" or "output" and an
    auto-incremented number suffix.
  - Add mnemonics for all input/output channel dialog fields.
- When running under NSM, closing the main window only hides UI and the "Quit"
  menu entry is replaced with a "Hide" entry.
- Added a global option to always ask for confirmation when quitting
  jack_mixer.
- Allow drag'n'drop to change channel positions.
- Added ability to shrink/expand width of input and output channels.
- The font color of control group labels automatically adapts to their
  background color for better contrast and readability.
- Fixed: Ctrl-click on volume fader sets it to 0.0 dbFS, not 1.0.
- Fixed: some issues with channel monitoring.
- Fixed: don't create empty project file on new NSM session.
- Fixed: on project load, give input focus to fader of last added channel and
  deselect volume entry widget so keyboard input doesn't accidentally change
  the value.
