# OALD isn't included because it's got a more restrictive (non-commercial
# only) license. OALD voices not included for same reason.

# Note on voice versions: I'm simply using the file date of the newest file
# in each set of tarballs. It happens that the dates for all files from each
# source (diphone, cmu_arctic, etc.) match, which is handy.

# Requires: festival-voice
# The hard dep below provides a festival-voice, no need to require it here.

# This is hard-coded as a requirement because it's the smallest voice (and,
# subjectively I think the most pleasant to listen to and so a good
# default).
#
# Ideally, this would be a "suggests" instead of a hard requirement.
#
# Update: with the new nitech versions of the voices, slt-arctic is no
# longer the smallest. But... AWB has a strong scottish accent, and JMK a
# kind of odd canadian one, so they're not great candidates for inclusion.
# And I find RMS a bit hard to understand. BDL isn't much smaller than SLT,
# and since I like it better, I think I'm going to keep it as the default
# for a price 12k. So, in case anyone later questions why this is the
# default, there's the answer. :)

%description
Festival is a general multi-lingual speech synthesis system developed
at CSTR. It offers a full text to speech system with various APIs, as
well as an environment for development and research of speech synthesis
techniques. It is written in C++ with a Scheme-based command interpreter
for general control.

%description -n festvox-kal-diphone
American English male speaker ("Kevin") for Festival.

This voice provides an American English male voice using a residual excited
LPC diphone synthesis method. It uses the CMU Lexicon pronunciations.
Prosodic phrasing is provided by a statistically trained model using part of
speech and local distribution of breaks. Intonation is provided by a CART
tree predicting ToBI accents and an F0 contour generated from a model
trained from natural speech. The duration model is also trained from data
using a CART tree.


%description -n festvox-rab-diphone
British English male speaker ("RAB") for Festival.

This voice provides a British English male voice using a residual excited
LPC diphone synthesis method. It uses the CMU Lexicon for pronunciations.
Prosodic phrasing is provided by a statistically trained model using part of
speech and local distribution of breaks. Intonation is provided by a CART
tree predicting ToBI accents and an F0 contour generated from a model
trained from natural speech. The duration model is also trained from data
using a CART tree.


%description -n festvox-awb-arctic-hts
US English male speaker ("AWB") for Festival. AWB is a native Scottish
English speaker, but the voice uses the US English front end.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1138 utterances spoken by a Scottish English male speaker. The
speaker is very experienced in building synthetic voices and matched
prompted US English, though his vowels are very different from US English
vowels. Scottish English speakers will probably find synthesizers based on
this voice strange. Unlike the other CMU_ARCTIC databases this was recorded
in 16 bit 16KHz mono without EGG, on a Dell Laptop in a quiet office. The
database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx using the FestVox
labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.


%description -n festvox-bdl-arctic-hts
US English male speaker ("BDL") for Festival.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1132 utterances spoken by a US English male speaker. The speaker
is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at 16bit
32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform, the
other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx using
the FestVox labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.


%description -n festvox-clb-arctic-hts
US English female speaker ("CLB") for Festival.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya
Institute of Technology, trained using the CMU ARCTIC database. This voice
is based on 1132 utterances spoken by a US English female speaker. The
speaker is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at
16bit 32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform,
the other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using CMU Sphinx
using the FestVox labelling scripts. No hand correction has been made.


%description -n festvox-jmk-arctic-hts

English speaker, but the voice uses the US English front end.

This is a HMM-based Speech Synthesis System (HTS) voice from the Nagoya

%description -n festvox-rms-arctic-hts

is based on 1132 utterances spoken by a US English male speaker. The speaker
is experienced in building synthetic voices. This was recorded at 16bit
32KHz, in a sound proof room, in stereo, one channel was the waveform, the
other EGG. The database was automatically labelled using EHMM an HMM labeler
that is included in the FestVox distribution. No hand correction has been
made.
