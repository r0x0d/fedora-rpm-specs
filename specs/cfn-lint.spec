# One function in cfnlint.maintenance calls “git grep”. It’s not entirely clear
# if this is really usable in a system-wide installation or not; it might be
# trying to operate on a git checkout of cfn-lint, which won’t be available. It
# doesn’t work for that reason when tested in
# TestUpdateDocumentation.test_update_docs, which is why there is no
# corresponding BuildRequires.
