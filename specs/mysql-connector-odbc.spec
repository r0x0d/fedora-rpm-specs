# Required for GUI
#   GUI currently off. To switch it ON, uncomment gtk buildrequires and change CMake argument DISABLE_GUI
#   GUI does not make any sense on headless servers for example, which is a valid use case. I don't want
#   this tiny package to have dependency on X and GTK.
# BuildRequires:  gtk3-devel
