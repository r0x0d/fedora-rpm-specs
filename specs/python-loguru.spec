# Fix deprecation warning raised by tests with Python 3.14
# https://github.com/Delgan/loguru/pull/1298
# Cherry-picked to 0.7.3
Patch:          0001-Fix-deprecation-warning-raised-by-tests-with-Python-.patch

BuildArch:      noarch

BuildRequires:  python3-devel

# The dev extra pins exact versions and includes unwanted coverage tools etc.
# (https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#_linters), 
# and developer tools, so we enumerate test dependencies manually:
BuildRequires:  %{py3_dist colorama}
BuildRequires:  %{py3_dist freezegun}
BuildRequires:  %{py3_dist pytest}

# Normally we should not depend on typecheckers or linters, but the test that
# uses mypy is simply confirming that the stub file is valid and usable. That
# seems OK. Alternatively, we could pass --ignore=tests/test_type_hinting.py to
# %%pytest.
BuildRequires:  %{py3_dist mypy}
