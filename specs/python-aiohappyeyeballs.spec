%global common_description %{expand:
This library exists to allow connecting with Happy Eyeballs (RFC 8305) when you
already have a list of addrinfo and not a DNS name.

The stdlib version of loop.create_connection() will only work when you pass in
an unresolved name which is not a good fit when using DNS caching or resolving
names via another method such as zeroconf.}
