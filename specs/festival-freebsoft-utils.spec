# We don’t actually need any of these to build, but BR’ing our runtime
# dependencies makes sure we don’t build a package that will fail to install.
BuildRequires:  festival
BuildRequires:  sox
BuildRequires:  /usr/bin/iconv

Requires:       festival
# From docs/festival-freebsoft-utils.texi:
#   Having SoX (@url{http://sox.sourceforge.net}) installed is strongly
#   recommended, many festival-freebsoft-utils functions don't work without it.
Recommends:     sox
# From docs/festival-freebsoft-utils.texi:
#   As Festival does not support UTF-8 encoding, festival-freebsoft-utils uses
#   the iconv utility for character coding conversions.
# Note that this is currently provided by glibc-common, so it should be
# available even without the explicit dependency.
Recommends:     /usr/bin/iconv

%description
A collection of utilities that enhance Festival with some useful features. They
provide all that is needed for interaction with Speech Dispatcher.

Key festival-freebsoft-utils features are:

• Generalized concept of input events. festival-freebsoft-utils allows not only
  plain text synthesis, but also combining it with sounds. Additionally,
  mechanism of logical events mapped to other events is provided.
• Substitution of events for given words.
• High-level voice selection mechanism and setting of basic prosodic parameters.
• Spelling mode.
• Capital letter signalization.
• Punctuation modes, for explicit reading or not reading punctuation characters.
• Incremental synthesis of texts and events.
• Speech Dispatcher support.
• Rudimentary SSML support.
• Enhance the Festival extension language with functions commonly used in Lisp.
• Support for wrapping already defined Festival functions by your own code.
• Everything is written in the extension language, no patching of the Festival
  C++ sources is needed.
