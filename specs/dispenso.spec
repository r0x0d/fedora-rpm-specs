%global _description %{expand:
Dispenso is a library for working with sets of tasks in parallel. It provides
mechanisms for thread pools, task sets, parallel for loops, futures, pipelines,
and more. Dispenso is a well-tested C++14 library designed to have minimal
dependencies (some dependencies are required for the tests and benchmarks), and
designed to be clean with compiler sanitizers (ASAN, TSAN). Dispenso is
currently being used in dozens of projects and hundreds of C++ files at Meta
(formerly Facebook). Dispenso also aims to avoid major disruption at every
release. Releases will be made such that major versions are created when a
backward incompatibility is introduced, and minor versions are created when
substantial features have been added or bugs have been fixed, and the aim would
be to only very rarely bump major versions. That should make the project
suitable for use from main branch, or if you need a harder requirement, you can
base code on a specific version.}
