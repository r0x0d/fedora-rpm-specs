%description
Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit that makes it easy
to build Web APIs.

Some reasons you might want to use REST framework:

* The Web browsable API is a huge usability win for your developers.
* Authentication policies including OAuth1a and OAuth2 out of the box.
* Serialization that supports both ORM and non-ORM data sources.
* Customizable all the way down - just use regular function-based views if
  you don't need the more powerful features.
* Extensive documentation, and great community support.
