%description
This library is intended as a not-quite-drop-in replacement for certain
functionality provided by CPAN distribution File-Copy-Recursive. The library
provides methods similar enough to that distribution's fcopy() and dircopy()
functions to be usable in those CPAN distributions often described as being
part of the Perl toolchain.

  - File::Copy::Recursive 0.41 has been released to CPAN and addresses the
    problem which was the focus of File::Copy::Recursive::Reduced; Hence, FCR2
    is now feature-complete

- Update to 0.005
  - Introduce rcopy(), a stripped-down replacement for
    File::Copy::Recursive::rcopy()
  - Implement copying of symlinks within all three public functions; at this
    point we should be able to make substitutions for File::Copy::Recursive's
    fcopy(), dircopy() and rcopy() functions in a large proportion of toolchain
    libraries, particularly in test suites

* Wed Apr 18 2018 Paul Howarth <paul@city-fan.org> - 0.003-1
