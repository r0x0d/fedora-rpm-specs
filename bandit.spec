%description
Bandit provides a framework for performing security analysis of Python source
code, utilizing the ast module from the Python standard library.

The ast module is used to convert source code into a parsed tree of Python
syntax nodes. Bandit allows users to define custom tests that are performed
against those nodes. At the completion of testing, a report is generated
that lists security issues identified within the target source code.
