%global _description %{expand:
The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and
scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python
based language. They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and
cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition.
Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software,
which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment.}

# Snakemake uses (unversioned) "python" as the default remote execution

# to lack "python3.exe" (see https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99185),
# we didn’t try to convince upstream to change this. Instead, we (reluctantly)
# just make sure that our own Snakemake installations are compatible by
# depending on python-unversioned-command.
