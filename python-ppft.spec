ppft is a fork of Parallel Python, and is developed as part of pathos:
https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos

Parallel Python module (pp) provides an easy and efficient way to create
parallel-enabled applications for SMP computers and clusters. pp module
features cross-platform portability and dynamic load balancing. Thus
application written with pp will parallelize efficiently even on heterogeneous
and multi-platform clusters (including clusters running other application with
variable CPU loads). Visit http://www.parallelpython.com for further
information.

ppft is part of pathos, a python framework for heterogeneous computing. ppft is
in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments, or
suggestions are highly appreciated. A list of issues is located at
https://github.com/uqfoundation/ppft/issues, with a legacy list maintained at
https://uqfoundation.github.io/project/pathos/query.}
