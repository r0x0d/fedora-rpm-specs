# However, some tests are disabled by default, becasue they require:
#  a) tested tox to be installed and/or
#  b) internet connection
# To run them, do the following:
#  1) Build --without ci_tests (the default) and optionally --without tests
#     (e.g. fedpkg mockbuild --without tests)
#  2) Install the built package
#     (e.g. mock install ./results_python-tox/.../tox-...rpm)
#  3) Build again --with ci_tests (and internet connection)
#     (e.g. fedpkg mockbuild --no-clean-all --enable-network --with ci_tests)
# The Fedora CI tests do this.

%global _description %{expand:
Tox as is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you
can use for:

 - checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions
   and interpreters
 - running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool
   of choice
 - acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers, greatly reducing
   boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.}

Summary:        %{summary}

# Recommend "all the Pythons"
# Why? Tox exists to enable developers to test libraries against various Python
# versions, with just "dnf install tox" and a config file.
# See: https://developer.fedoraproject.org/tech/languages/python/python-installation.html#using-virtualenv
# Tox itself runs on the system python3 (i.e. %%{python3_version},
# however it launches other Python versions as subprocesses.
# It recommends all Python versions it supports. (This is an exception to
# the rule that Fedora packages may not require the alternative interpreters.)
