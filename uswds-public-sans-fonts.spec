%global fontdescription   %{expand:
Public Sans is a fork of the Libre Franklin font family. Libre Franklin is a
reinterpretation and expansion of the 1912 Morris Fuller Benton’s classic.
Public Sans has many similarities with its parent, but diverges enough in its
particulars that its effect is distinct.

Overall, Public Sans differs from Libre Franklin in its focus on long form
reading and neutral UI applicability. It takes inspiration from geometric sans
faces of the 20th century, as well as the original Franklins of the 19th,
resulting in something of a mongrel face that retains its American origin.

Public Sans is designed to work well with Apple and Google system fonts as the
base in its font stack. It’s designed to have metrics most similar to SF Pro
Text (the Apple system font) and to fall somewhere between SF Pro Text and
Roboto (the Google system font) in its overall size and appearance.}
