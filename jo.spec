# This is a copylib and not designed to be built as a separate library. See
# https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bundled_Libraries_Virtual_Provides; even under
# the old guidelines, in which bundled libraries required FPC exemptions, a
# variety of similar CCAN modules had exemptions as copylibs.
#
# Inspection of https://github.com/rustyrussell/ccan/tree/master/ccan/json
# shows the bundled code is consistent with version 0.1 (as declared in a
# comment in https://github.com/rustyrussell/ccan/blob/master/ccan/json/_info),
# but has been forked with various small modifications in json.c.
Provides:       bundled(ccan-json) = 0.1

# The public-domain base64 implementation looks like a copylib, but I could not
# find the upstream from which it was copied, so I am not treating it as a
# bundled dependency.
