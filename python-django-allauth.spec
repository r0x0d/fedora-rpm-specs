%global _description %{expand:
Integrated set of Django applications addressing authentication, registration,
account management as well as 3rd party (social) account authentication.

## Rationale
Most existing Django apps that address the problem of social authentication
focus on just that. You typically need to integrate another app in order to
support authentication via a local account.

This approach separates the worlds of local and social authentication. However,
there are common scenarios to be dealt with in both worlds. For example, an
e-mail address passed along by an OpenID provider is not guaranteed to be
verified. So, before hooking an OpenID account up to a local account the e-mail
address must be verified. So, e-mail verification needs to be present in both
worlds.

Integrating both worlds is quite a tedious process. It is definitely not a
matter of simply adding one social authentication app, and one local account
registration app to your INSTALLED_APPS list.

This is the reason this project got started – to offer a fully integrated
authentication app that allows for both local and social authentication, with
flows that just work.}
