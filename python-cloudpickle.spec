%global desc cloudpickle makes it possible to serialize Python constructs \
not supported by the default pickle module from the Python standard \
library. cloudpickle is especially useful for cluster computing where \
Python expressions are shipped over the network to execute on remote \
hosts, possibly close to the data. Among other things, cloudpickle \
supports pickling for lambda expressions, functions and classes defined \
interactively in the __main__ module.
