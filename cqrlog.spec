%description
CQRLOG is an advanced ham radio logger based on MySQL database. Provides radio
control based on hamlib libraries (currently support of 140+ radio types and 
models), DX cluster connection, QRZ callbook (web version), a grayliner, 
internal QSL manager database support and a most accurate country resolution 
algorithm based on country tables developed by OK1RR. CQRLOG is intended for 
daily general logging of HF, CW & SSB contacts and strongly focused on easy 
operation and maintenance.
