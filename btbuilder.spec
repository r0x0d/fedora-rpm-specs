%description
Bt Builder is a turn based role-playing game builder and engine in the style
of the old Bard's Tale series. It completely supports the functionality of the
Bard's Tale Construction Set. The eventual goal is to make a game builder that
can implement the three main Bard's Tale games in addition to Construction Set
games.
